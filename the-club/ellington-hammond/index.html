<p>Ellington Hammond, officially, is responsible for ensuring the optimal sound frequency and translation of ancient growls, moans, and cries. Though he’s most often found playing the voice of reason when missions go awry. No sir – you won’t catch him diving into questionably instable volcanic pits. But don’t mistake his sense for softness. Rumor has it that he once punched a manatee, off the coast of Djibouti, so hard that it swam backwards for the rest of its adult life. But shhh.</p>

These are preliminary offerings from a larger and more comprehensive effort to explore ways to add layers and depth to online product presentation.</p>

<p> Sometimes, you just gotta bring it back to square one. The violently bright 90′s tones, the unmistakable public display of athleticism, the rotary neck force of innocent bystanders. Fssssh, fsssh, fsssh goes the nylon. This was home for us.</p>

<p> The Madbury Club recently embarked on a halfway-confidential mission alongside our comrades at Puma. Stories of mythical creatures have been passed down for generations. We weren’t content with simply hearing stories. We decided to seek our own. The video and visual documents collected are the only remaining artifacts from the trip.The stories, research, and documentation that follow is nothing short of legend. This is Chazebralope.</p>

<p> The Club broke early from their afternoon Jai-Alai match to make the quick flight from Philadelphia International to Belize. The exact reason for this trip is considered sensitive for as long as the IRS is still an operating entity but from all appearances it seem as though quite the Cosmic time took place South of the border.</p>

<p> Timberland asked us to create some content around the GT Scramble and since we were unable to to achieve our initial idea which involved battle with mountain goats, we decided to try to breathe some new life into the static art form known as a product shot. The result, we'd like to think, is a more moving, dynamic portrait that reflects some of the capabilities of the boot, but mostly it's an incredibly well positioned excuse to look at a great piece of footwear in a way that's more interesting than the standard issue white backdrop.</p>

<p> It was an album that went down in infamy, and we were there to put our two ( twenty) cents in on our first impressions. Another incredibly funk filled Spread. The Club Wordsmiths in full effect.</p>

<p> With great fun comes get responsibility, and that responsibility mostly entails spending far too many hours behind a computer screen. Setting out to find new tradition, and a break from anything involving a Mac OS, we set out for a barren stretch of beach dunes in Staten Island.</p>

<p> Zero gravity isn’t for the faint of heart, it’s for the faint of soles. Which is why, ultimately in preparation, we decided to strap on a pair of the Nike Zoom Meriweathers and go ricocheting off some of nature’s sturdiest.</p>
