<p>Some say he was born in the woods and raised with Kodiak bear cubs. Others say he’s a glorified Boy Scout with particularly long limbs. Evidently, Chief Exploratory Officer Phillip T. Annand’s background is as mysterious as the journeys he embarks on. A scar on his left arm, in the shape of a cowbell, is said to reveal his true origins when prodded with tweezers drenched in rubbing alcohol. But that could also just be infection as a result of eating squirrels for the past two weeks.</p>

<p> The Madbury Club recently embarked on a halfway-confidential mission alongside our comrades at Puma. Stories of mythical creatures have been passed down for generations. We weren’t content with simply hearing stories. We decided to seek our own. The video and visual documents collected are the only remaining artifacts from the trip.The stories, research, and documentation that follow is nothing short of legend. This is Chazebralope.</p>

<p> The Club broke early from their afternoon Jai-Alai match to make the quick flight from Philadelphia International to Belize. The exact reason for this trip is considered sensitive for as long as the IRS is still an operating entity but from all appearances it seem as though quite the Cosmic time took place South of the border.</p>

<p> Timberland asked us to create some content around the GT Scramble and since we were unable to to achieve our initial idea which involved battle with mountain goats, we decided to try to breathe some new life into the static art form known as a product shot. The result, we'd like to think, is a more moving, dynamic portrait that reflects some of the capabilities of the boot, but mostly it's an incredibly well positioned excuse to look at a great piece of footwear in a way that's more interesting than the standard issue white backdrop.</p>
