 <p>Some say he was born in the woods and raised with Kodiak bear cubs. Others say he’s a glorified Boy Scout with particularly long limbs. Evidently, Chief Exploratory Officer Phillip T.

A scar on his left arm, in the shape of a cowbell, is said to reveal his true origins when prodded with tweezers drenched in rubbing alcohol.

       <p> With Thanksgiving just a day away, 10.Deep has taken the wraps off the first delivery of its Holiday 2014 collection. Dubbed “Town and Country,” the new drop eschews the internet-centric designs of its autumnal releases in favor of a focus on the non-digital world. For the first delivery, 10.Deep looked to the functional apparel that provided much of the stylistic framework for what would eventually evolve into the streetwear of today. The result is a range that draws inspiration from vintage hunting apparel, motocross pieces, and classic workwear while incorporating more contemporary graphics and details — sort of “streetwear for the everyman.”</p>

       <p> Timberland asked us to create some content around the GT Scramble and since we were unable to to achieve our initial idea which involved battle with mountain goats, we decided to try to breathe some new life into the static art form known as a product shot. The result, we'd like to think, is a more moving, dynamic portrait that reflects some of the capabilities of the boot, but mostly it's an incredibly well positioned excuse to look at a great piece of footwear in a way that's more interesting than the standard issue white backdrop.</p>
