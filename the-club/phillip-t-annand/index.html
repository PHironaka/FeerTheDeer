<p> On behalf of our good friends at Native Shoes, Madbury embarked on a 3 part editorial production showcasing their finest footwear from their SS15 collection.  A word from our sponsors:

The earth is our home. The global precession is here. From sea level to mountain top, from core to surface, from longitude to latitude. Hanging ten on the seven seas, clad stomping around these noble continents. That’s what it comes down to. This time around we meld many cultures, many nations and even many weathers under one beautiful, flowing flag. Japanese embroidery, african kente, scottish pride, american patina. These all have a place under the roof of our rain-filled clouds. Clouds which have little effect now that rain-enforced silhouettes have been added to the fray. Welcome to (y)our world, wayward traveler. Rest thy weary feet.</p>
