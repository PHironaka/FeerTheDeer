       <p> This holiday season, 10.Deep moves away from the internet focus of the fall back to the non-digital world with their “Town and Country” collection. This first delivery derives from the functional apparel that originally provided much of the framework for “pre-streetwear.” Drawing inspiration from vintage hunting, motocross and workwear, the offerings acts as streetwear for the ordinary individual. For the lookbook, 10.Deep teamed up with Phillip T. Annand and The Madbury Club, who took the collection on location to bring the gear closer to the origins of its inspiration. The delivery is the first of their “Black Weekend” releases, and will be available exclusively at the brand’s online store beginning Black Friday and at your local retailers in the coming weeks.</p>

       <p> They turned the corner into a plaza, gutted clean of all traces of life. There they found an abandoned shop for oriental noodle based sustenance laying dormant and inviting. Still no signs of sunlight. The door automatically shuts behind them. The “accident” is almost upon them now. A flash and a bang. The light is taking them to pieces. The bleached surroundings submit willingly, pale and insubstantial in the many refractions of infrared; the sudden flares of ultraviolet. Sunburn in April.</p>

       <p> Timberland asked us to create some content around the GT Scramble and since we were unable to to achieve our initial idea which involved battle with mountain goats, we decided to try to breathe some new life into the static art form known as a product shot. The result, we'd like to think, is a more moving, dynamic portrait that reflects some of the capabilities of the boot, but mostly it's an incredibly well positioned excuse to look at a great piece of footwear in a way that's more interesting than the standard issue white backdrop.</p>
