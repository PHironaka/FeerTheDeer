<p>Ask Mama Picone what Vinny does best and she’ll say he’s a helluva Pictionary player. Ask her what he does nearly as good and she’ll say take photos with that “light-box machine thingy.” And you know what they say: Mama knows best. Vinny’s knack for picture taking has steadily grown throughout the course of his twenty-five years. His process is methodical, at times, taking months on end to develop exposures that focus on framing more than the mythical subject he’s commissioned to capture. You may call him crazy – we call him brother</p>

(Or at least partially human, as in the case of Club favorite and now honorary Madbury member Robin Lopez) And though it somehow never came up, we’re 99.7% confident that all of them wanted no parts in facing TMC on the court. We can dream.</p>

<p> The 8th battalion. Sunrays absent form a pasty grey mass overhead. It’s the crux of Springtime in a long-since forgotten yesteryear, and the stench of desolation hangs heavy in the air. Charred vehicles pile themselves at the margins of the road, and skyscraper remains shudder in the coarse winds, freshly chewed to their core.</p>

The exact reason for this trip is considered sensitive for as long as the IRS is still an operating entity but from all appearances it seem as though quite the Cosmic time took place South of the border.</p>

<p> Timberland asked us to create some content around the GT Scramble and since we were unable to to achieve our initial idea which involved battle with mountain goats, we decided to try to breathe some new life into the static art form known as a product shot. The result, we'd like to think, is a more moving, dynamic portrait that reflects some of the capabilities of the boot, but mostly it's an incredibly well positioned excuse to look at a great piece of footwear in a way that's more interesting than the standard issue white backdrop.</p>
