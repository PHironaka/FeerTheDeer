<p>You can’t win them all, except when you do. That saying has absolutely nothing to do with the life and times of Bryan Stevenson but it sure sounds cool. Anyways. The Club has changed some. But Bryan has changed the Club. A passing interest in doodling evolved into a full-fledged career in map-making, allowing him to chart territories of the world widely undiscovered and thus unknown to the greater public. His findings are legendary. But his story is untold. Just the way he intends it – for now.</p>

<p> The Madbury Club recently embarked on a halfway-confidential mission alongside our comrades at Puma. Stories of mythical creatures have been passed down for generations. We weren’t content with simply hearing stories. We decided to seek our own. The video and visual documents collected are the only remaining artifacts from the trip.The stories, research, and documentation that follow is nothing short of legend. This is Chazebralope.</p>

<p> The 8th battalion. Sunrays absent form a pasty grey mass overhead. It’s the crux of Springtime in a long-since forgotten yesteryear, and the stench of desolation hangs heavy in the air. Charred vehicles pile themselves at the margins of the road, and skyscraper remains shudder in the coarse winds, freshly chewed to their core.</p>

The exact reason for this trip is considered sensitive for as long as the IRS is still an operating entity but from all appearances it seem as though quite the Cosmic time took place South of the border.</p>
