Still no signs of sunlight. The door automatically shuts behind them. The “accident” is almost upon them now. A flash and a bang. The light is taking them to pieces. The bleached surroundings submit willingly, pale and insubstantial in the many refractions of infrared; the sudden flares of ultraviolet. Sunburn in April.</p>
