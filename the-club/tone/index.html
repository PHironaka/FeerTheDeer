       <p> This holiday season, 10.Deep moves away from the internet focus of the fall back to the non-digital world with their “Town and Country” collection. This first delivery derives from the functional apparel that originally provided much of the framework for “pre-streetwear.” Drawing inspiration from vintage hunting, motocross and workwear, the offerings acts as streetwear for the ordinary individual. For the lookbook, 10.Deep teamed up with Phillip T. Annand and The Madbury Club, who took the collection on location to bring the gear closer to the origins of its inspiration. The delivery is the first of their “Black Weekend” releases, and will be available exclusively at the brand’s online store beginning Black Friday and at your local retailers in the coming weeks.</p>

       <p> They turned the corner into a plaza, gutted clean of all traces of life. There they found an abandoned shop for oriental noodle based sustenance laying dormant and inviting. Still no signs of sunlight. The door automatically shuts behind them. The “accident” is almost upon them now. A flash and a bang. The light is taking them to pieces. The bleached surroundings submit willingly, pale and insubstantial in the many refractions of infrared; the sudden flares of ultraviolet. Sunburn in April.</p>

       <p> A six part video series starring NBA players executed by The Madbury Club for Sprint. We traveled to cities, arenas and mother’s living rooms on a mission to prove that professional basketball players were indeed human.
 
(Or at least partially human, as in the case of Club favorite and now honorary Madbury member Robin Lopez) And though it somehow never came up, we’re 99.7% confident that all of them wanted no parts in facing TMC on the court. We can dream.</p>

       <p> The Madbury Club recently embarked on a halfway-confidential mission alongside our comrades at Puma. Stories of mythical creatures have been passed down for generations. We weren’t content with simply hearing stories. We decided to seek our own. The video and visual documents collected are the only remaining artifacts from the trip.The stories, research, and documentation that follow is nothing short of legend. This is Chazebralope.</p>
