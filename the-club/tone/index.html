       <p> They turned the corner into a plaza, gutted clean of all traces of life. There they found an abandoned shop for oriental noodle based sustenance laying dormant and inviting. Still no signs of sunlight. The door automatically shuts behind them. The “accident” is almost upon them now. A flash and a bang. The light is taking them to pieces. The bleached surroundings submit willingly, pale and insubstantial in the many refractions of infrared; the sudden flares of ultraviolet. Sunburn in April.</p>

       <p> With Thanksgiving just a day away, 10.Deep has taken the wraps off the first delivery of its Holiday 2014 collection. Dubbed “Town and Country,” the new drop eschews the internet-centric designs of its autumnal releases in favor of a focus on the non-digital world. For the first delivery, 10.Deep looked to the functional apparel that provided much of the stylistic framework for what would eventually evolve into the streetwear of today. The result is a range that draws inspiration from vintage hunting apparel, motocross pieces, and classic workwear while incorporating more contemporary graphics and details — sort of “streetwear for the everyman.”</p>

       <p> Here at The Club every possible attempt is made to avoid brain draining mass emails at every and all junctures: thank you for joining us.

For your viewing pleasure: Join Madbury on a five minute deep space exploration from California to Hong Kong and back again detailing how exactly a sneaker is made, from start to finish. And because that alone would only be so interesting there is also a blue, three foot troll named Benjamin. Produced alongside our friends at Native Shoes and Hypebeast. </p>

       <p> The Madbury Club recently embarked on a halfway-confidential mission alongside our comrades at Puma. Stories of mythical creatures have been passed down for generations. We weren’t content with simply hearing stories. We decided to seek our own. The video and visual documents collected are the only remaining artifacts from the trip.The stories, research, and documentation that follow is nothing short of legend. This is Chazebralope.</p>
