      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some say he was born in the woods and raised with Kodiak bear cubs. Others say he’s a glorified Boy Scout with particularly long limbs. Evidently, Chief Exploratory Officer Phillip T. Annand’s background is as mysterious as the journeys he embarks on. A scar on his left arm, in the shape of a cowbell, is said to reveal his true origins when prodded with tweezers drenched in rubbing alcohol. But that could also just be infection as a result of eating squirrels for the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not Hyun’s first intergalactic rodeo. Prior to aligning forces with the Club, he led sieges on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth moons in Saturn’s gravitational pull. These days, he spends much more time organizing instead of colonizing. As the elder statesmen in a gang of lollygaggers, Hyun is now tasked with making sure missions stay the course while managing to avoid, figuratively, pulling his hair out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Marcus Arman doesn’t remember his birthday. But he can recite the alphabet in sixty-four dialects, all of which date back to or before the standing of the Ottoman Empire. A chronic case of amnesia may make daily tasks quite difficult, but he’s not paid to know how to operate a vehicle or remember his eye color. He’s paid to ease communication between the past and present – something he does with the efficiency of three woodpeckers in a lumber-yard.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We discovered Peter playing golf on a course of his own design approximately four hours North of Los Angeles. &amp;ldquo;Chicks dig the long ball,&amp;rdquo; he winked before slicing a ball three-hundred yards. &amp;ldquo;Even if the sun is setting.&amp;rdquo; Following a brief conversation, he decided to leave the safety of his conventional job for the promise of the enticing inability to explain what it is he does to any suit-clad elder.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;South Florida. Chefchaouen. Paris. Bogota. Peru. He is a man who does not believe in Zip Codes or resting his head some place for longer than a hummingbird&amp;rsquo;s heartbeat. Our Interalactic friend has made traveling the globe with a trustee 35mm his mission in life. Our newest member, and lifelong brother, Darryl.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ellington Hammond, officially, is responsible for ensuring the optimal sound frequency and translation of ancient growls, moans, and cries. Though he’s most often found playing the voice of reason when missions go awry. No sir – you won’t catch him diving into questionably instable volcanic pits. But don’t mistake his sense for softness. Rumor has it that he once punched a manatee, off the coast of Djibouti, so hard that it swam backwards for the rest of its adult life. But shhh.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Ask Mama Picone what Vinny does best and she’ll say he’s a helluva Pictionary player. Ask her what he does nearly as good and she’ll say take photos with that “light-box machine thingy.” And you know what they say: Mama knows best. Vinny’s knack for picture taking has steadily grown throughout the course of his twenty-five years. His process is methodical, at times, taking months on end to develop exposures that focus on framing more than the mythical subject he’s commissioned to capture. You may call him crazy – we call him brother&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You can’t win them all, except when you do. That saying has absolutely nothing to do with the life and times of Bryan Stevenson but it sure sounds cool. Anyways. The Club has changed some. But Bryan has changed the Club. A passing interest in doodling evolved into a full-fledged career in map-making, allowing him to chart territories of the world widely undiscovered and thus unknown to the greater public. His findings are legendary. But his story is untold. Just the way he intends it – for now.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt Surveyance is the Winter 2013 chapter of a quarterly editorial effort intended to document the stylistic leanings of The Club, immediate friends, and close family. The following portraits are not intended to be instructional or aspirational. Nor are they intended to be in line with any current trends or dictations of the fashion universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These portraits represent the current stylings of Club members across the globe and nothing else. And while this description may seem overly serious, the approach to the styles documented here is anything but. Quarterly Observance on behalf of The Madbury Club. Winter 001. 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
