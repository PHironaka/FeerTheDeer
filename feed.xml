      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not Hyun’s first intergalactic rodeo. Prior to aligning forces with the Club, he led sieges on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth moons in Saturn’s gravitational pull. These days, he spends much more time organizing instead of colonizing. As the elder statesmen in a gang of lollygaggers, Hyun is now tasked with making sure missions stay the course while managing to avoid, figuratively, pulling his hair out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some say he was born in the woods and raised with Kodiak bear cubs. Others say he’s a glorified Boy Scout with particularly long limbs. Evidently, Chief Exploratory Officer Phillip T. Annand’s background is as mysterious as the journeys he embarks on. A scar on his left arm, in the shape of a cowbell, is said to reveal his true origins when prodded with tweezers drenched in rubbing alcohol. But that could also just be infection as a result of eating squirrels for the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Roosevelt Surveyance is the Winter 2013 chapter of a quarterly editorial effort intended to document the stylistic leanings of The Club, immediate friends, and close family. The following portraits are not intended to be instructional or aspirational. Nor are they intended to be in line with any current trends or dictations of the fashion universe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These portraits represent the current stylings of Club members across the globe and nothing else. And while this description may seem overly serious, the approach to the styles documented here is anything but. Quarterly Observance on behalf of The Madbury Club. Winter 001. 2013.&lt;/p&gt;
