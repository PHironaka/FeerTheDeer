      <title>Nylon Expeditions: A Madbury Editorial Experiment.</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, you just gotta bring it back to square one. The violently bright 90′s tones, the unmistakable public display of athleticism, the rotary neck force of innocent bystanders. Fssssh, fsssh, fsssh goes the nylon. This was home for us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Club is obviously back with a fresh new site and a revamped outlook, but the fuck-never-given antics are still the same. What started out as a healthy morning jog became something entirely different by lunchtime. We’re not prone to skimping on theatrics so we conjured up the most pompous getups we could find and scoured the streets. We took to the finer parts of New York City so we could showcase the squad in it’s full roster form (bless you Marcus), and also just so we could piss some people off. What ensued was pure disruption of Monday morning grumpiness, traffic flow, retinal sensitivity and the occasional AstroTurf Kung Fu tryout. And thank you to those kind women who graciously placed coins in the hat during our dance routine. We surely didn’t spend it all in one place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Photographed by our good friend and frequent partner in crime: NICK ONKEN.The Order of the Nylon Hand is one of many choice outings schemed up by The Club and its braintrust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*We have premonitions, sometimes. And the editorial you see above is a direct result of one we had while stranded in a desert drinking Jameson. Enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moonstompin: A Planetary Recon</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Zero gravity isn’t for the faint of heart, it’s for the faint of soles. Which is why, ultimately in preparation, we decided to strap on a pair of the Nike Zoom Meriweathers and go ricocheting off some of nature’s sturdiest. What with the upcoming privatized missions to Mars and the like, we figured Lord Elon would need some astro-ready citizens. But how to decide the footwear for a new frontier? Must we take inspiration from the likes of Pharrell and Lil’ “not the same” Wayne? Maybe steal a page from Mr. McFly’s recently released memoirs?
Oh no, no, of course not. We’ve chosen the best-in-class for such matters, the Nike ACG Hiking Boot to rule them all.
The Zoom Meriweather boasts a sockliner so comfortable, cushioning so responsive, it’s the clear choice for any plummets or vaults of the extra-galactic variety. And if the lunar sands lodged betwixt our gridded traction wasn’t a sign, it might’ve been the supple-as-a-Saturnese-ring suede upper that sealed our fate. Heed our words when we say that the rugged folks at Nike truly manufacture Gear for All Conditions. ACG: getting you to infinity and then some.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is not Hyun’s first intergalactic rodeo. Prior to aligning forces with the Club, he led sieges on the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth moons in Saturn’s gravitational pull. These days, he spends much more time organizing instead of colonizing. As the elder statesmen in a gang of lollygaggers, Hyun is now tasked with making sure missions stay the course while managing to avoid, figuratively, pulling his hair out.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some say he was born in the woods and raised with Kodiak bear cubs. Others say he’s a glorified Boy Scout with particularly long limbs. Evidently, Chief Exploratory Officer Phillip T. Annand’s background is as mysterious as the journeys he embarks on. A scar on his left arm, in the shape of a cowbell, is said to reveal his true origins when prodded with tweezers drenched in rubbing alcohol. But that could also just be infection as a result of eating squirrels for the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
