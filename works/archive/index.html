  <p>This holiday season, 10.Deep moves away from the internet focus of the fall back to the non-digital world with their “Town and Country” collection. This first delivery derives from the functional apparel that originally provided much of the framework for “pre-streetwear.” Drawing inspiration from vintage hunting, motocross and workwear, the offerings acts as streetwear for the ordinary individual. For the lookbook, 10.Deep teamed up with Phillip T. Annand and The Madbury Club, who took the collection on location to bring the gear closer to the origins of its inspiration. The delivery is the first of their “Black Weekend” releases, and will be available exclusively at the brand’s online store beginning Black Friday and at your local retailers in the coming weeks.</p>
